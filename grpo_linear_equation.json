To do this, we need to find a common multiple of 30 and 15. The least common multiple is 30, so we will multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y the same:\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: -50x -60y = -2720\nEquation 2 multiplied by 2: 34x -30y = -62\n\nNow we subtract the second equation from the first:\n(-50x -60y) - (34x -30y) = -2720 - (-62)\n-84x = -2658\nx = -2658 / -84\nx = 32\n\nNow that we have x, we can substitute it back into either equation to find y.
