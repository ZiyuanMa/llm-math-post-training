Multiply Equation 1 by 13 to align the coefficients of y with Equation 2:\n   -20x + 27y = 66\n   becomes\n   -260x + 351y = 858\n\n3. Now, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate y:\n   -260x + 351y = 858\n   -(-312x + 26y = -6084)\n   ---------------------------------\n   52x + 325y = 6942\n\n4. Divide the entire equation by 52 to simplify:\n   x + 6.25y = 133.157\n\n5. Now, substitute x = 133.157 - 6.25y into one of the original equations. I'll use Equation 2:\n   -24x + 2y = -468\n   -24(133.157 - 6.25y) + 2y = -468\n   -3236.58 + 150y + 2y = -468\n   152y = 2768.58\n   y = 18.1\n\n6. Substitute y = 18.1 back into the equation for x:\n   x = 133.157 - 6.25(18.1)\n   x = 133.157 - 113.8125\n   x = 19.3445\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\nx = 19.3445, y = 18.1",
