Equation 1 becomes: -160x - 24y = -1712. Equation 2 becomes: -33x + 72y = 705. Now, add the two equations together: (-160x - 24y) + (-33x + 72y) = -1712 + 705. This simplifies to -193x + 48y = -1007. We want to eliminate y, so let's try a different approach. Multiply Equation 1 by 8: -160x - 24y = -1712. Multiply Equation 2 by 3: -33x + 72y = 705. We need to find constants a and b such that a(-25x - 3y) + b(-11x + 24y) = 0 and that simplifies to the coefficients of x and y being equal. This implies -25a - 11b = 0 and -3a + 24b = 0. From -3a + 24b = 0, we have 3a = 24b, so a = 8b. Substituting this into -25a - 11b = 0 gives -25(8b) - 11b = 0, so -200b - 11b = 0, or -211b = 0, implying b=0 and a=0, which is not useful.  Let's go back to the original equations. Multiply Equation 1 by 8: -200x - 24y = -1712. Multiply Equation 2 by 1: -11x + 24y = 235. Adding the two gives: -211x = -1477, so x = -1477/-211 = 7.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"First, we'll multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate 'x'. Equation 2 becomes 30x - 42y = 2088. Now, we can subtract the first equation from this modified second equation: (30x - 42y) - (30x + 24y) = 2088 - 174, which simplifies to -66y = 1914.  Dividing both sides by -66, we get y = -28.91 (approximately). Let's re-examine our steps, as we should obtain integers. Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second by 4 to eliminate y. Equation 1 becomes 210x + 168y = 1218. Equation 2 becomes 60x - 84y = 4176. Now, multiply the first equation by 7 and second by 3 to remove 'y': Equation 1: 210x + 168y = 1218. Equation 2 multiplied by 3: 45x - 63y = 1044*3 = 3132. Now, multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second by -2 gives: 90x + 72y = 5154 and -30x + 42y = -2088. Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives: 30x - 42y = 2088. Multiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by -4 to remove y: 210x + 168y = 1218. -60x + 84y = -4176. It seems like we can't easily eliminate y with multiplication, let's try eliminating x. Multiply the first equation by 15 and the second by -30, which will eliminate x. (30x + 24y = 174) * 15 -> 450x + 360y = 2610. (15x - 21y = 1044) * -30 -> -450x + 630y = -31320. Adding these two equation give 990y = -28710. y = -28710 / 990 = -29. So y = -29. Now, substituting y = -29 into Equation 1: 30x + 24(-29) = 174 -> 30x - 696 = 174 -> 30x = 870 -> x = 870 / 30 = 29. Therefore x=29 and y=-29.\",\n\"solution\": {\n  \"x\": 29,\n  \"y\": -29\n}\n}",

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the system of equations -14x + 16y = -424 and 4x - 15y = 288, we can use the elimination method. First, multiply the second equation by 7/4 to make the coefficient of x match that of the first equation: (7/4)(4x - 15y) = (7/4)(288) => 7x - (105/4)y = 504. This isn't very useful. Let's multiply the second equation by 14/4 = 3.5 instead.  Then we have 14x - 42y = 1008. Now, add the first equation to this new equation to eliminate x: (-14x + 16y) + (14x - 42y) = -424 + 1008 => -26y = 584. Divide by -26 to find y: y = 584 / -26 = -22.46, which is not an integer, so we need to revise the plan. Instead, let's multiply the second equation by 7 to eliminate x: (7)(4x - 15y) = (7)(288) => 28x - 105y = 2016. Now multiply the first equation by -14/4 = -3.5: (-3.5)(-14x + 16y) = (-3.5)(-424) => 49x - 56y = 1484. Let's multiply equation 1 by 1.75 to obtain 4x: 1.75 * -14x + 1.75*16y = 1.75 * -424 => -24.5x + 28y = -742. Again this doesn't work. To eliminate x, multiply the second equation by 14/4 = 3.5. That is, 3.5 * 4x - 3.5 * 15y = 3.5*288 --> 14x - 52.5y = 1008. Now add this equation to -14x + 16y = -424 --> 0x -36.5y = 584 --> -36.5 y = 584 --> y = 584/-36.5 = -16. It seems we're not going to get integers. Let's try another approach. Multiply first equation by 15, and second equation by 16: -210x + 240y = -6360, 64x - 240y = 4608. These sums cancel y! So -146x = -1752 and x = -1752/-146 = 12. Now we have 4(12) - 15y = 288 --> 48 - 15y = 288 --> -15y = 240 --> y = -16.\", \"solution\": {\"x\": 12, \"y\": -16}}",

Now, multiply Equation 2 by -1. So we get 84x + 28y = 1316. Then, multiply Equation 1 by 4. So, -20x + 108y = -1116. Now, we will eliminate y by subtracting the updated equation 1 from the updated equation 2. (-20x + 108y) - (-84x + 28y) = -1116 - 1316. This simplifies to -20x + 108y + 84x - 28y = -2432. Therefore, 64x + 80y = -2432. Divide by 16 to simplify further: 4x + 5y = -152. Now we can solve for x in Equation 1. -5x + 27y = -279.  Let's multiply Equation 2 by -6 to make the y coefficient 24: -12x - 4y = -188 becomes 72x + 24y = 1128. Now multiply the updated Equation 1 by -4. -5x + 27y = -279 becomes 20x - 108y = 1116. Solve for y by multiplying Equation 2 by 6. (-12x - 4y) * 6 = -188 * 6; -72x - 24y = -1128.  Adding this to -20x + 108y = 1116: -92x + 84y = -13. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 4 to align y coefficients. -5x + 27y = -279; -20x + 108y = -1116. Multiply Equation 2 by 27. -12x - 4y = -188; -324x - 108y = -5148. Now, we want to get y alone in equation 2 to use elimination. -12x -4y = -188 -> -4y = 12x - 188. Then, y = -3x + 47. Substitute this into Equation 1: -5x + 27(-3x + 47) = -279. -5x -81x + 1269 = -279. -86x = -1548. x = 18. Now find y: y = -3(18) + 47. y = -54 + 47 = -7.\",\"solution\": {\"x\": 18, \"y\": -7}}\n",

It seems there was a calculation mistake. Let's try eliminating y instead. Multiply equation (1) by 15 and equation (2) by 4. This gives: 255x - 120y = 1995 (3) and 104x + 120y = 2672 (4). Adding equations (3) and (4) gives: (255x - 120y) + (104x + 120y) = 1995 + 2672, which simplifies to 359x = 4667. Therefore, x = 4667 / 359 = 13. So, x = 13. Substituting x = 13 into equation (1): 17(13) - 8y = 133, which gives 221 - 8y = 133. Therefore, -8y = 133 - 221 = -88, so y = -88 / -8 = 11. Checking with equation (2): 26(13) + 30(11) = 338 + 330 = 668.  The solution is x = 13 and y = 11.\", \"solution\": { \"x\": 13, \"y\": 11 } }",

Multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 4: 3*Equation 1: -48x - 69y = 2109; 4*Equation 2: 96x - 16y = -368. Multiply the first equation by 2: -96x - 138y = 4218.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the system of equations 28x - 11y = -9 and -6x + 17y = 163, we can use the method of elimination. First, we multiply the second equation by a constant so that the coefficient of x is the additive inverse of the coefficient of x in the first equation. Multiply the second equation by 14/6 = 7/3: (7/3)(-6x + 17y) = (7/3)(163) which simplifies to (-14x + (119/3)y) = 1141/3. This doesn't lead to integer coefficients, so instead, multiply the first equation by 3 to get 84x - 33y = -27, and multiply the second equation by 7 to get -42x + 119y = 1141.  Now, multiply the first equation by 7, and the second by 2 to eliminate x: (7)(28x - 11y = -9) -> 196x - 77y = -63 and (2)(-6x + 17y = 163) -> -12x + 34y = 326. This doesn't give additive inverse coefficients for x, so try a different strategy. Let's eliminate x. Multiply equation 1 by 6: 168x - 66y = -54. Multiply equation 2 by 28: -168x + 476y = 4564. Now add the modified equations: (168x - 66y) + (-168x + 476y) = -54 + 4564 which simplifies to 410y = 4510.  Thus, y = 4510 / 410 = 11. Now, substitute y = 11 into the first equation: 28x - 11(11) = -9. So 28x - 121 = -9.  Then, 28x = 112, which means x = 112 / 28 = 4.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"We can solve the system of equations using elimination. First, multiply Equation 1 by 4 and Equation 2 by -5 to eliminate y. Equation 1 becomes 120x - 56y = 1560, and Equation 2 becomes -30x - 80y = -1800. Now, add the two equations: (120x - 56y) + (-30x - 80y) = 1560 + (-1800), which simplifies to 90x - 136y = -240. This doesn't eliminate y. Let's try a different approach. Multiply equation 1 by 4: 120x - 56y = 1560. Multiply equation 2 by -3: -18x - 48y = -1080. Let's instead multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 4. Then we have 120x - 56y = 1560 and 24x + 64y = 1440. Let's try elimination again. Multiply Equation 1 by 4 to get 120x - 56y = 1560. Multiply Equation 2 by -5 to get -30x - 80y = -1800. This is not helpful. Let's instead eliminate x. Multiply Equation 1 by 6: 180x - 84y = 2340. Multiply Equation 2 by -30: -180x - 480y = -10800. Then adding the two equations, -524y = -8460. So y = -8460 / -524 = 16.12. Let's proceed by trying another approach. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 4: 120x - 56y = 1560. Multiply Equation 2 by -5: -30x - 80y = -1800. Adding them yields: 90x - 136y = -240. Now let's multiply Eq 1 by 4 and Eq 2 by -1 to get 120x - 56y = 1560 and -6x - 16y = -360. Then we multiply the second equation by 3.5 to get -21x - 56y = -1260. Substracting this from 120x - 56y = 1560, we get 141x = 2820, which leads to x = 20. Now substitute x=20 into Eq 2: 6(20) + 16y = 360, so 120 + 16y = 360, leading to 16y = 240, hence y = 15.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"First, we can simplify Equation 1 by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in 3x - y = 39. We can then solve for y in terms of x: y = 3x - 39. Now, substitute this expression for y into Equation 2: 18x - 19(3x - 39) = -39.  Expanding the equation gives 18x - 57x + 741 = -39.  Combining like terms results in -39x = -400. Dividing both sides by -39 gives x = 400/39. To find y, we substitute x = 400/39 back into y = 3x - 39: y = 3(400/39) - 39 = 1200/39 - 39 = 1200/39 - (39*39)/39 = 1200/39 - 1521/39 = -321/39 = -83.57 which doesn't seem correct.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by -24 to eliminate x. This gives us: 168x - 210y = 4032 and -264x + 504y = -7728. Next, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by -1 to eliminate y. This gives us 336x - 420y = 8064 and -11x + 21y = -322. Solving the equations can be tricky so let's solve the original equations with a different approach. To eliminate x, multiply the first equation by 11 and the second by -24. This yields: 264x - 330y = 6336 and -264x + 504y = -7728. Adding these two equations eliminates x: 174y = -1392. Thus y = -1392/174 = -8. Now substitute y = -8 into the first equation: 24x - 30(-8) = 576 => 24x + 240 = 576 => 24x = 336 => x = 336/24 = 14.

Now, add the modified Equation 1 and Equation 2: (-75x - 30y) + (100x + 150y) = -2160 + 3650. This simplifies to 25x + 120y = 1490. This step seems to have an error, let's try eliminating x instead. Multiply Equation 1 by 6 and Equation 2 by 5: -150x - 60y = -4320 and 100x + 150y = 3650. Multiply Equation 1 by 5: -1000x - 150y = -15000. Multiply Equation 2 by -1: -100x - 150y = -3650.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the elimination method. Equation 1 is 11x - 8y = 177 and Equation 2 is 10x + 20y = 270. First, we can multiply Equation 1 by 5 to match the coefficients of y in both equations: 5 * (11x - 8y) = 5 * 177, which simplifies to 55x - 40y = 885. Now, multiply Equation 2 by 2 to eliminate the y variable: 2 * (10x + 20y) = 2 * 270, which gives 20x + 40y = 540. Now, add the modified Equation 1 and Equation 2: (55x - 40y) + (20x + 40y) = 885 + 540, which results in 75x = 1425. Divide both sides by 75 to find x: x = 1425 / 75 = 19. Substitute x = 19 into Equation 2: 10(19) + 20y = 270, which simplifies to 190 + 20y = 270. Subtract 190 from both sides: 20y = 270 - 190 = 80. Divide both sides by 20 to find y: y = 80 / 20 = 4.

Now we have two equations: -14x - 10y = 24 and -73.33x + 10y = -810. Adding the two equations eliminates y: (-14x - 10y) + (-73.33x + 10y) = 24 + (-810). This simplifies to -87.33x = -786. Now, divide both sides by -87.33: x = -786 / -87.33 = 9. Therefore, x = 9. Now substitute x = 9 into the first equation: -14(9) - 10y = 24. This gives -126 - 10y = 24.

Subtracting the first from the second equation gives 224x = 19888, so x = 19888/224 = 89.  Now, we substitute x = 89 into the first equation: -2(89) + 15y = 413, which gives -178 + 15y = 413. This implies that 15y = 413 + 178 = 591. Therefore, y = 591 / 15 = 39.4. This does not work.  Let's multiply the first equation by 14 and the second by 2 to get: -28x + 210y = 5782 and 28x + 16y = 772. Summing the two gives 226y = 6554 so y = 6554/226 = 29.  Substitute y=29 into Equation 1: -2x + 15(29) = 413. This simplifies to -2x + 435 = 413, so -2x = 413 - 435 = -22, which gives x = 11. Let's check the solution x=11 and y=29 in the original equations: -2(11) + 15(29) = -22 + 435 = 413. 14(11) + 8(29) = 154 + 232 = 386. Both equations hold true.\", \"solution\": {\"x\": 11, \"y\": 29}}",

Now, divide by 558 to find y: y = 13410 / 558 = 24.0289... However, it appears that there is rounding errors and we should re-evaluate the equations and check for errors in the coefficients. Let's check our multiplications: 9x + 18y = 351  -> 9x + 18y = 351 * 23 = 207x + 414y = 8100 - 1. -23x + 16y = 591 -> -23x + 16y = 591 * 9 = -207x + 144y = 5319 So there was a computation error.

Equation 1 becomes: 78x + 63y = -1590. Equation 2 becomes: -27x - 126y = 3051. Now, multiply Equation 1 by 4.5 to get 351x + 283.5y = -7455. Multiply Equation 2 by 0.5 to get -1.35x - 14y = -339.  Alternatively, let's use the simpler method of multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second by -1 to eliminate y instead.  This gives us: 52x + 42y = -1060 and -6x - 28y = 678.

Multiply Equation 2 by 2 to get 12x + 56y = -1356. Now we have two equations to get x. Let's multiply Eq1 by 4, and Eq2 by -3. This results in: 208x + 168y = -2120 and -18x - 84y = 2034. The original strategy of getting rid of y looks much better. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 4: 104x + 84y = -2120. Multiply Equation 2 by -3: -18x - 84y = 2034. Adding the two new equations gives: 86x = -86. Therefore, x = -1. Substitute x = -1 into Equation 2: 6(-1) + 28y = -678. This simplifies to -6 + 28y = -678. Then 28y = -672, so y = -672/28 = -24.

Subtracting the second equation from the modified first equation, we get: (-20x + 108y) - (-20x + 10y) = 1424 - 640 => 98y = 784.  Dividing both sides by 98, we get: y = 784 / 98 = 8.

Divide both sides by 92 to find x: x = 1932 / 92 = 21. Now, substitute x = 21 into Equation 2: 11(21) + 24y = 615  =>  231 + 24y = 615. Subtract 231 from both sides: 24y = 615 - 231 = 384. Divide both sides by 24 to find y: y = 384 / 24 = 16. Therefore, x = 21 and y = 16.\", \"solution\": {\"x\": 21, \"y\": 16}}",

However, this is not leading to an easy simplification, so let's try to eliminate x instead. Multiply Equation 1 by 23 and Equation 2 by 20. This gives: Equation 3: -460x - 46y = 11186, and Equation 4: 460x - 520y = -27500. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 yields -566y = -16314.

Now, subtract the second modified equation from the first: (108x + 204y) - (108x - 225y) = 3180 - 1035. This simplifies to 459y = 2145.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 1 to ensure the y coefficients have opposite signs. Equation 1 becomes -16x - 4y = 36. Equation 2 remains -23x + 4y = 237. Adding the two equations eliminates y: (-16x - 4y) + (-23x + 4y) = 36 + 237, which simplifies to -39x = 273. Dividing both sides by -39 gives x = -7. Substituting x = -7 into the first equation: -16(-7) - 4y = 36, which simplifies to 112 - 4y = 36. Subtracting 112 from both sides yields -4y = -76. Dividing both sides by -4 gives y = 19.

The least common multiple of 28 and 16 is 112.\\nEquation 1 * 4: -120x + 112y = 5592\\nEquation 2 * -7: -189x + 112y = 7455\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second yields: \\n(-189x + 112y) - (-120x + 112y) = 7455 - 7455 -5592\\n-69x = 1863\\nx = -1863 / -69 = 27\\nNow, substitute x = 27 into Equation 1: \\n-30(27) + 28y = 1398\\n-810 + 28y = 1398\\n28y = 1398 + 30(27) = 2208\\n28y = 2208\\ny = 2208 / 28 = 79\\nTherefore, x = 27 and y = 28 *79. I will double-check the arithmetic.\\nLet x = 27. Substitute this into Equation 2: \\n27(27) - 16y = -1065\\n729 - 16y = -1065\\n-16y = -1065 - 729 = -1794\\ny = -1794 / -16 = 112.125, which is not correct. We have a math error.\\nLet's start again.

Distribute the -22: 8x + 15202 + 660x = -830. Combine like terms: 668x = -16132. Divide by 668: x = -16132 / 668 = -24.1. However, the problem asks for an exact solution. Let's recalculate: Equation 1: 8x - 22y = -830. Equation 2: 30x + y = -691. From Equation 2: y = -691 - 30x. Substitute into Equation 1: 8x - 22(-691 - 30x) = -830.  8x + 15202 + 660x = -830. 668x = -16132. x = -16132 / 668 = -24.1. This is still not an integer. Let's double-check our work. Equation 1: 8x - 22y = -830. Equation 2: 30x + y = -691. Multiply Equation 2 by 22: 660x + 22y = -15202. Add this to Equation 1: 8x - 22y + 660x + 22y = -830 - 15202. 668x = -16032. x = -16032 / 668 = -24.  Now substitute x = -24 into Equation 2: 30(-24) + y = -691. -720 + y = -691. y = -691 + 720 = 29.

This simplifies to -97x = 1358. Divide both sides by -97 to find x: x = -1358 / -97 = 14. The original equation 1 is 7x + 9y = -80. Substitute x = 14 into the equation: 7(14) + 9y = -80. This becomes 98 + 9y = -80. Subtract 98 from both sides: 9y = -80 - 98 = -178. Divide both sides by 9: y = -178 / 9. After re-examining the calculations, an error was made in the multiplication factors. Let's use a different approach. Multiply equation 1 by 17 and equation 2 by -9. 17 * (7x + 9y = -80) -> 119x + 153y = -1360. -9 * (24x + 17y = -302) -> -216x - 153y = 2718. Adding these gives -97x = 1358. Thus x = -1358/(-97) = 14. Substitute x = 14 in 7x + 9y = -80. 7(14) + 9y = -80. 98 + 9y = -80. 9y = -80 - 98 = -178. y = -178/9. After re-examination, the math was still incorrect. let's try another approach by multiplying equation 1 by 17 and equation 2 by -9 to eliminate y: 17(7x + 9y = -80) => 119x + 153y = -1360. -9(24x + 17y = -302) => -216x - 153y = 2718. Adding gives: -97x = 1358, x = -1358/(-97) = 14. Substituting x = 14 in 7x + 9y = -80: 7(14) + 9y = -80, 98 + 9y = -80, 9y = -178, y = -178/9. This value for y is incorrect. Let's use Cramer's rule: D = 7*17 - 9*24 = 119 - 216 = -97. x = (-80 * 17 - (-302 * 9)) / -97 = (-1360 + 2718) / -97 = 1358 / -97 = -14. y = (7 * (-302) - (-80) * 24) / -97 = (-2114 + 1920) / -97 = -194 / -97 = 2.\",\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"x\": -14,\n    \"y\": 2\n  }\n}",

There must be a rounding error. Let's re-examine. -3x - 19y = -144 and -x + 25y = 234. Multiply the second equation by -3: 3x - 75y = -690. Add this to the first equation: (-3x - 19y) + (3x - 75y) = -144 - 702 + (-144 + (-690)). This gives -94y = -834. Now y = -834 / -94 = 8.8723.  That is still wrong, which means I made a mistake.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 4: x - 6y = 70.  Then, x = 70 + 6y. Substituting this into the first equation: -18(70 + 6y) + 16y = -64. This expands to -1260 - 108y + 16y = -64. Simplifying, we have -92y = 1216. Thus, y = -1216/92 = -13.1739... which is likely a calculation error. Let's try multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second by 18 to eliminate x. Equation 1 becomes: -72x + 64y = -256. Equation 2 becomes: 72x - 432y = 5040. Adding these equations gives -288y = 4480. Thus, y = -4480/288 = -310/18 = -155/9. This is also not an integer. Let's multiply equation 1 by 4 to get -72x + 64y = -256, and multiply equation 2 by 18 to get 72x - 432y = 5040. Adding the two yields -288y = 4480, so y = -4480/288 = -155/9. That's not right either. Let's resolve by multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by -18: -72x + 64y = -256. -72x + 432y = -5040. Multiplying first equation by 4 and second equation by -1, we get -72x + 64y = -256, and -4x+24y = -280. The second one can be simplified to x -6y = 70. So x = 70 + 6y. Substituting in first: -18(70+6y) + 16y = -64. That is -1260 - 108y + 16y = -64. So, -92y = 1216, which makes y = -1216/92 = -13.1739... which still looks incorrect. Multiply Eq 1 by 2: -36x + 32y = -128. Multiply Eq 2 by 9: 36x - 216y = 2520. Add equations: -184y = 2400, so y = -2400/184 = -300/23. Still wrong. Let's try multiplying Eq 1 by 1 and Eq 2 by -2 to remove y. -18x + 16y = -64. -8x + 48y = -560. Now multiply Eq 1 by 3: -54x + 48y = -192. Now subtract this from -8x+48y=-560.  -54x + 48y = -192 ->  -54x + 48y = -192 and -8x + 48y = -560. Subtract these to get -46x = 368 or x = -8.  Then -18(-8) + 16y = -64. 144 + 16y = -64. 16y = -208. y = -13. Check: 4(-8) - 24(-13) = -32 + 312 = 280. Correct.\",\"solution\": {\"x\": -8, \"y\": -13}}",

Now, substitute y = 28 into Equation 2: 3x - 7(28) = -169 => 3x - 196 = -169 => 3x = -169 + 196 => 3x = 27 => x = 27 / 3 => x = 9.

Now subtract the first equation from this new equation: (27x + 621y) - (27x - 7y) = -14881 - 141 => 628y = -15022. Now, we divide both sides by 628: y = -15022 / 628 = -23.9587... Since we are dealing with a system of linear equations, we expect an integer solution. Let's recheck our calculations. Equation 2 multiplied by 27: 27x + 621y = -14881. Subtracting Equation 1: (27x + 621y) - (27x - 7y) = -14881 - 141. This gives 628y = -15022. Let's recheck the numbers in the original question and our initial operations. 27x -7y = 141, x + 23y = -553. Let's eliminate y instead. Multiply Equation 1 by 23 and Equation 2 by 7: 23(27x - 7y) = 23(141) => 621x - 161y = 3243. 7(x + 23y) = 7(-553) => 7x + 161y = -3871. Adding these equations: (621x - 161y) + (7x + 161y) = 628x + 0y = 628x = 628x = 628x = 628x = -3871 + 3243. So, 628x = -628. x = -628 / 628 = -1.

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"To solve the system of equations: 17x + 23y = 214 and -4x + 2y = 172, we can use the elimination method. First, multiply the second equation by 17/4 to eliminate x. This gives us -17x + (34/4)y = (172 * 17/4). Simplifying, we have -17x + (17/2)y = 713/2. Now, add this modified equation to the first equation: 17x + 23y = 214. Adding the two equations, we get: (23 + 17/2)y = 214 + 355.5. This simplifies to (46/2 + 17/2)y = 569.5, which means (63/2)y = 569.5. Multiplying both sides by 2/63, we get y = (569.5 * 2)/63 = 1139/63 = 18.0476... However, that is not an easy number to continue with. Let's try solving again. Let's multiply Equation 2 by 23/2: (-4x + 2y) * (23/2) = 172 * (23/2), resulting in -23x + 11y = 1978.

Equation 1 becomes 58x + 52y = -2402. Equation 2 remains 4x + 24y = -676. Now, multiply Equation 1 by 2.5 to get 58x * 2.5 = 145x, 52y * 2.5 = 130y. Equation 1 becomes 145x + 130y = -6005.  Next, we'll multiply Equation 2 by -2.5 to get 4x * -2.5 = -10x and 24y * -2.5 = -60y. Equation 2 becomes -10x - 60y = 1690. Now, we'll find coefficients to eliminate y. Multiply Equation 1 by 5 to get 29x * 5 = 145x and 26y * 5 = 130y. Equation 1 becomes 145x + 130y = -6005. Multiply Equation 2 by 13/6 = 2.1666... but it is easier to find a common multiple of 24 and 52 to eliminate y. Let's multiply Equation 2 by 13/6. It's even more complex to do so. Instead, we'll multiply the first equation by 6 and the second by -13. 6 * (29x + 26y = -1201) -> 174x + 156y = -7206. -13 * (4x + 24y = -676) -> -52x - 312y = 8788. However, it is easier to multiply equation 2 by -26/24 = -13/12.  Instead of using fractions, let's just solve it by using elimination using substitution.  From Equation 2, we can isolate x: 4x = -676 - 24y, so x = -169 - 6y. Substitute this into Equation 1: 29(-169 - 6y) + 26y = -1201. -4901 - 174y + 26y = -1201. -148y = -1201 + 4901 = 3700. y = 3700 / -148 = -25. Thus, x = -169 - 6*(-25) = -169 + 150 = -19. Verify: 29*(-19) + 26*(-25) = -551 - 650 = -1201. 4*(-19) + 24*(-25) = -76 - 600 = -676. Therefore x = -19, y = -25.\",\n\"solution\": {\n  \"x\": -19,\n  \"y\": -25\n}\n}",

        "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"We can solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method. First, we multiply Equation 1 by 7 to make the coefficients of y opposites: 7*(-11x + 6y) = 7*26, which simplifies to -77x + 42y = 182. Then, we multiply Equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal: 2*(-28x -21y) = 2*574, which simplifies to -56x - 42y = 1148. Now we add the two resulting equations together: (-77x + 42y) + (-56x - 42y) = 182 + 1148, which simplifies to -133x = 1330. Dividing both sides by -133, we get x = -10. Substituting x = -10 into Equation 1: -11(-10) + 6y = 26, which simplifies to 110 + 6y = 26. Subtracting 110 from both sides, we get 6y = -84.
