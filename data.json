        "response": "<think>First, we can simplify Equation 1 by dividing all terms by -7 to get x + 3y = 31. Then, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. We can multiply Equation 2 by 3 to get -3x - 42y = -159. Now, we can add this to Equation 1 after rearranging it to -7x - 21y = -217. This gives us -7x - 21y - 3x - 42y = -217 - 159, simplifying to -10x - 63y = -376. We can further simplify by dividing the whole equation by -1 to get 10x + 63y = 376. Now, we can solve for x using the original simplified Equation 2: x + 3y = 31. We can express x as x = 31 - 3y and substitute it into 10x + 63y = 376. This gives us 10(31 - 3y) + 63y = 376, which simplifies to 310 - 30y + 63y = 376, or 33y = 66, so y = 2.

Using the method of elimination, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second (simplified) equation by 5 to eliminate y. This gives us 4x + 10y = -198 and 15x + 10y = -495. Subtracting the first from the second, we get 11x = -297, so x = -27. Substituting x = -27 into the first original equation, 2(-27) + 5y = -99, we get -54 + 5y = -99, so 5y = -45, and y = -9.</think>\n<answer>x = -27, y = -9</answer>",
